The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory. <br>
It states that if you take sufficiently large samples from a population, the samples’ means will be normally distributed, even if the population isn’t normally distributed¹².<br> 
This theorem is key because it implies that probabilistic and statistical methods that work for normal distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions³.<br><br>

The CLT relies on the concept of a sampling distribution, which is the probability distribution of a statistic for a large number of samples taken from a population¹. <br>
Suppose you draw a random sample from a population and calculate a statistic for the sample, such as the mean. If you repeat this process many times, you end up with a large number of means, one for each sample.<br>
The distribution of these sample means is an example of a sampling distribution¹. <br>
The CLT says that this sampling distribution of the mean will always be normally distributed, as long as the sample size is large enough¹.<br><br>

The proof of the Central Limit Theorem is quite complex and involves advanced mathematical concepts.
In essence, it relies on the law of large numbers and the properties of independent sequences⁴³. <br>
The theorem says that under rather general circumstances, if you sum independent random variables and normalize them accordingly, then at the limit (when you sum lots of them) you'll get a normal distribution⁴.<br><br>

As for simulations, they are a great way to visualize the Central Limit Theorem.<br>
For instance, if you were to roll a dice several times and find the mean of each sample, you would notice that although the original data (the dice rolls) have a flat "uniform" distribution, the sample means have a bell-shaped "normal" distribution⁶.<br>
This is because in a sample of several rolls the highs and lows will "average out", so the sample mean is far more likely to be close to 3.5, rather than as low as 1 or as high as 6⁶.<br>
You can try running simulations with different sample sizes to see how the distribution of sample means changes⁶. There are also online resources available where you can run these simulations⁶⁷⁸.
