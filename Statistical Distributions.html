Statistical distributions are mathematical functions that describe the likelihood of different outcomes from a random process. <br>
They are fundamental to the field of statistics and data analysis. There are two main types of statistical distributions: continuous and discrete⁹.<br><br>

Continuous Distributions:<br>
Continuous distributions describe variables that can take on any value within a specified range³⁴. <br>
The probabilities of continuous random variables are defined as the area under the curve of its Probability Density Function (PDF)⁴.<br>
Examples of continuous distributions include the Normal distribution, Exponential distribution, and Pareto distribution⁹².<br><br>

Discrete Distributions:<br>
Discrete distributions describe variables that can only take on a countable number of values⁶. These values are typically non-negative integers⁶.<br>
For a discrete distribution, probabilities can be assigned to the values in the distribution³.<br>
Examples of discrete distributions include the Binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, and Bernoulli distribution¹⁵.<br><br>

Properties of Distributions:<br>
The properties of a distribution describe its characteristics and behavior. The three basic properties of a distribution are location, spread, and shape[^10^].<br>
The location refers to the typical value of the distribution, such as the mean. <br>
The spread of the distribution is the amount by which smaller values differ from larger ones[^10^].<br>
The shape of the distribution can be described by its skewness and kurtosis⁹.<br><br>

Simulations of Distributions:<br>
Simulations are a powerful tool for understanding and visualizing statistical distributions.<br>
They allow you to generate a sequence of random variables from a specific distribution, calculate statistics, and observe how these statistics behave as the number of observations increases¹³¹⁴¹⁶.<br>
This can help you understand the properties of the distribution and see its implications in practice. <br>
Monte Carlo simulations, for example, use repeated sampling to obtain the statistical properties of some phenomenon¹⁵.<br><br>
