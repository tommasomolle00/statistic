                    M servers are subject to attacks during a period of time T (for instance 1 year).
                    Subdivide the interval T in N subinterval of size T/N and in each of this suppose that an attack can occur with probability Î» T/N.
                    Simulate the attacks to the M servers and represent each of them with a line which
                    makes jumps of 1 at each attack event.

                    Using the same objects ("movable/resizable rectangle", histogram, etc.) of the previous homework 3
                    draw vertically on the line chart the 2 histograms representing the distribution of the number
                    of attacks at the end of the period and one internal istant for comparison.
                    Study what happens asymptotically, for N large, and a number of systems M a sufficient to give shape to
                    a simulated distribution. Make some personal considerations about the shape and the average of the distributions that you see.

                    Find out on the web about a Poisson point process. See if you can see any analogy with this Exercise and verify whether your distributions come close (for N, M sufficiently large)
                    to the theoretical asymptotic distribution. </span>
