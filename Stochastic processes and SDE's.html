A stochastic process is a mathematical model that describes phenomena where uncertainty is present¹.<br>
In other words, it's a sequence of random variables representing the evolution of some system of random values over time¹.<br><br>

Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a type of differential equation in which one or more of the terms is a stochastic process, resulting in a solution which is also a stochastic process¹.<br>
SDEs have many applications throughout pure mathematics and are used to model various behaviors of stochastic models such as <br>
stock prices, random growth models, or physical systems that are subjected to thermal fluctuations¹.<br><br>

SDEs can be classified into three basic types²:<br>
1. Random Initial Conditions: This is the most simple type, it is just an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with random initial conditions².<br>
2. Random inhomogeneous parts: These are more complicated and refer to SDEs².<br>
3. Random coefficients: These are also more complicated and refer to SDEs².<br><br>

The most common form of SDEs in the literature is an ordinary differential equation with the right-hand side perturbed by a term dependent on a white noise variable¹.<br>
In most cases, SDEs are understood as the continuous-time limit of the corresponding stochastic difference equations¹.<br><br>

The mathematical theory of stochastic differential equations was developed in the 1940s through the groundbreaking work of Japanese mathematician Kiyosi Itô, 
<br>who introduced the concept of stochastic integral and initiated the study of nonlinear stochastic differential equations¹.<br>
Another approach was later proposed by Russian physicist Stratonovich, leading to a calculus similar to ordinary calculus¹.<br><br>

The Itô integral and Stratonovich integral are related, but different, objects and the choice between them depends on the application considered¹.<br>
The Itô calculus is based on the concept of non-anticipativeness or causality, which is natural in applications where the variable is time¹.<br><br>
