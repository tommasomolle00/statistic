The Poisson process is a mathematical model that describes the occurrence of events in a fixed interval of time or space¹².<br>
It's named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson and is used in various fields such as telecommunications, traffic engineering, and computational biology¹².<br><br>

Here are some key properties of the Poisson process¹²:<br>
1. Independence: The numbers of events in non-overlapping intervals are independent⁴.<br>
2. Stationarity: The distribution of the number of arrivals between any two points in time depends only on the length of the time interval, not on the starting point².<br>
3. Memorylessness: The time until the next event does not depend on when the previous event happened¹². This property is deeply connected to the exponential distribution, which is memoryless².<br>
4. Arrival Rate: For any interval of size t, λt is the expected number of arrivals in that interval¹. Thus λ is called the arrival rate of the process¹.<br><br>

A Poisson process can be simulated using a computer program. The basic steps are as follows²:<br>
1. Initialize a counter (N) to zero.<br>
2. Generate an exponentially distributed random number (T) with rate λ.<br>
3. If T is less than the desired time window, increment N and add another exponentially distributed random number to T.<br>
4. Repeat step 3 until T exceeds the desired time window.<br>
5. N is now a random variable with a Poisson distribution, representing the number of events in the time window.<br><br>

This simulation procedure is based on the properties of the Poisson process and the exponential distribution².<br>
            It's a simple yet powerful method for modeling random events in time or space².<br>
