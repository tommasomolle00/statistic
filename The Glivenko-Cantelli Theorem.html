          <label>
The Glivenko–Cantelli theorem, sometimes referred to as the Fundamental Theorem of Statistics, is a principle in the theory of probability¹. <br>
It was formulated in 1933 by Valery Ivanovich Glivenko and Francesco Paolo Cantelli¹². <br> 
The theorem determines the asymptotic behavior of the empirical distribution function as the number of independent and identically distributed observations grows¹.<br><br>

Meaning:<br>
The theorem states that if you have a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with a common cumulative distribution function, 
the empirical distribution function for this sequence converges to the actual distribution function almost surely¹.<br>
This means that as you collect more data, your empirical distribution (the distribution you observe from your data) gets closer and closer to the true underlying distribution that the data is drawn from¹.
<br><br>

Proof:<br>
The proof of the Glivenko–Cantelli theorem involves several steps⁶⁷⁸. For simplicity, consider a case of a continuous random variable. <br>
The proof starts by defining a sequence of random variables which converge to a value almost surely by the strong law of large numbers¹. <br>
Glivenko and Cantelli strengthened this result by proving uniform convergence of the empirical distribution function to the actual distribution function¹.<br>
The proof involves concepts such as the strong law of large numbers, indicator functions, and almost sure convergence¹.<br><br>

Simulation:<br>
In terms of simulation, the Glivenko–Cantelli theorem can be visualized using various statistical software or programming languages.<br>
You can generate a sequence of random variables from a specific distribution, calculate the empirical distribution function,
and observe how it converges to the actual distribution function as the number of observations increases. <br>
This can help you understand the theorem better and see its implications in practice¹.<br><br>
