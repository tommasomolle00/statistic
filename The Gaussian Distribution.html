The Gaussian distribution, also known as the normal distribution, is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable¹. <br>
It is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean⁴. In graphical form, it appears as a "bell curve"².<br>
The peak of the graph is always located at the mean, and the area under the curve is always exactly equal to 1¹¹.<br><br>

The Gaussian distribution is defined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The standard normal distribution has zero mean and unit standard deviation¹².<br><br>

Derivation:<br>
The Gaussian distribution can be derived from the binomial probability mass function under specified conditions⁸. The famous de Moivre’s Laplace limit theorem proved this⁸. <br>
However, this approach is cumbersome as it relies heavily on many lemmas and theorems⁸. <br>
An alternative and less rigorous method of deriving the Gaussian distribution from basic random experiments has been proposed⁸.
<br><br>

Simulation:<br>
In terms of simulation, you can use software like MATLAB to work with the normal distribution interactively¹².<br>
You can create a probability distribution object by fitting a probability distribution to sample data or by specifying parameter values. 
Then, you can use object functions to evaluate the distribution, generate random numbers, and so on¹². <br>
There are also interactive online tools like Academo¹¹ and PhET¹⁴ that allow you to visualize and understand the Gaussian distribution better.
